# Unit-4-Quiz
I hate quizzes.. But this quiz is so easy!

1.Write a function, `max_value`, that takes in an integer and prints the numbers from 1 to that number inclusively.  

 

2.Write a function, `compare_lists`, that given two lists of the same length , will compare each element of the lists and print out the higher value at each index. 

 

 

3.Write a function, `swapping_stars`, that will print out the following:  

 

* - * - * - 

- * - * - * 

* - * - * - 

- * - * - * 

* - * - * - 

- * - * - * 

 

Bonus Qn

Write a function, `find_secret`, that takes in a list of lists and an item. Once it finds the item it will print both indexes of where the item is. 

 

Example: 

 

list_of_lists = [['where', 'is', 'the'], 

['very', 'secret', 'word'], 

['i', 'can', 'find'] 

] 

secret_item = 'secret' 

find_secret(list_of_lists, secret_item) # will print:  1, 1
