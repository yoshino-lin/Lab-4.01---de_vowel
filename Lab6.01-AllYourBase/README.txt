# Lab-6.01---All-your-Base
It is time for creating your own dictionary!

Write a dictionary that gives context to "internet memes". Write a program, dictionary_lab.py, that prompts a user for what meme or abbreviation they want to look up. If the word is in the dictionary (use the in keyword with an if statement to test), then you will print out the definition. If the word is not in the dictionary, the program will print out that the word is not defined.

Example Output
>>> python3 dictionary_lab.py
What word would you like to look up? nbd
nbd: a phrase meaning no big deal
What word would you like to look up? kittens
Sorry, kittens is not defined
What would would you like to look up?
Bonus!
Create a way to update values and add key/value pairs to the dictionary. Search for dictionaries in the Python documentation.
