Remove the Vowels
Create a function, de_vowel, which will take a string as input and return a copy of that string with all the vowels removed. Otherwise, the string should be the same.

Create the function contract for de_vowel.
Write de_vowel using a for loop
Provide a few examples that confirm de_vowel works as expected:
What if the string is all vowels?
What if there are no vowels?
What if there is a mix of vowels and non-vowels and spaces?

Bonus!
Use a counter (variable you define outside of a loop to keep track of a value inside a loop) to create a function count_vowels.
count_vowels takes in a string and returns an int representing the number of vowels in the string.
