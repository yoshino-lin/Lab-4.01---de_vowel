# Birthday-Song
Warn:
#I am still no sure whether this program is correct unless I get a A+ from my teacher's feedback. 
#I will share sth more later...
Now I get A+ yeah!

1) Create a function, birthday_song, that prints out the happy birthday song to whatever name is input as an argument. The contract should be:
# Name: birthday_song
# Purpose: birthday_song prints out a personalized birthday song
# Input: name, string 
# Returns: none
def birthday_song(name): 
    #your code goes here

2) Create a function that randomly picks 5 cards from a deck. The cards can repeat. Instead of creating a string for each card it might be useful to have two lists and pick randomly from both the lists. Write out the contract for this function:

number = ['A', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K']
suit = ['Spades', 'Clubs', 'Diamonds', 'Hearts']

Bonus!
Practice passing in lists as an argument to a function. What is different about passing in a list as an argument? Read in the associated reading about list aliasing and write down what is happening in this case.

#Sorry this bonus is too hard for me... Maybe I will become good enough to help you when you see this sentence...
