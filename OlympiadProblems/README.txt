2) Write a function that given two numbers, x and y, draws a rectangle of stars x wide, and y high (5 points) Requirement: No use of * string operator, use for loops.

Examples:

rect(4, 8)
 * * * *
 * * * *
 * * * *
 * * * *
 * * * *

3) Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a sentence. Don't count 'y' as a vowel, and remember to take care of upper case vowels. (5 points)

4) Write a function that takes a list of words, and returns a list of integers, where the integer is the number of vowels in the original word. (5 points)
