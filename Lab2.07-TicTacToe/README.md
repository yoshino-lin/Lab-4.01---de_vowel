# Lab-2.07---Tic-Tac-Toe
Remember the Tic-Tac-Toe game we started to create last week? We are going to keep implementing the game using a while loop.

Allow users to keep playing (max 9 times).
Use variables to decide whose turn it is, and greet them as Xs or Os.
User picks a location on the board according to the number: tic-tac-toe
Depending on the position user gave, update the corresponding position of the board to reflect that.
Print the updated board out.
You will not need to determine the winner at this point, we will revisit this again and complete the game in Unit 4!

You can puy me then I will tell you something about bonus :D
