# Lab-4-04-Part-2---Shopping-List
What! Shopping list again?!! Now the question become more serious...

Part 2
shopping_cart = [
['tooth paste', 'q-tips', 'milk'],
['milk', 'candy', 'apples'],
['planner', 'pencils', 'q-tips']
]
In this part of the lab you will go through your shopping list program and perform a few different calculations.

Create a function, all_in_one, that will put all the shopping lists into a single list using a for loop.
Create a function, count_q_tips, which will go through all items of the list and keep a count of how many times 'q_tips' occurs.
In order to make the shopping lists more calcium rich, write a function, drink_more_milk, that adds 'milk' to each of the lists (unless it's already there).
You can't have milk without cookies. Write a function if_you_give_a_moose_a_cookie, that will go through every element of schedule and update 'milk' to be 'milk and cookies'.
Bonus!
Write a function to reverse the order of the lists and items in shopping_cart.

The list should look like the following when printed:

schedule = [
['q-tips', 'pencils', 'planner'],
['apples', 'candy', 'milk'],
['milk', 'q-tips', 'toothe paste']
]
Tip
Last item can be gotten by my_list[-1]

Second to last element: my_list[-2]

Third to last element: my_list[-3]
