# Lab-4.03---Nested-For-loops
Now we cannot use while and *num... Loop with for in? Maybe we can try.

In this lab we will be drawing images using nested for loops.

For each of the following problems, you will write a function that will draw the desired output. You may use an extra function if you find it helpful.

Write a function, draw_7, to draw the 7x7 square (shown below)

 * * * * * * * 
 * * * * * * * 
 * * * * * * *

Write a function stars_and_stripes, that will draw a 3 sets of rows. 1st a row of 7 stars followed by a row of 7 dashes (shown below)

 1 2 3
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4 5 6
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Write a function, vertical_stars_and_stripes that will print out the following:
