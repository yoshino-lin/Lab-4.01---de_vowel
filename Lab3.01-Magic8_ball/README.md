# Lab-3.01---Magic-8-ball
Do you want to know whether you are lucky enough? Try this program!
1) Practice importing random, use randint with different arguments. Simulate a dice roll, printing out to the user what number they rolled.

2) Look at the documentation (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. of the random library. Experiment with another function (not randint) that returns a value.

3) Create a program that simulates a magic 8-ball (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Store all of the 8-ball's possible responses (shown below) in a list. Have the program prompt the user to ask the magic 8-ball a question, and then return and print a random response.

Magic 8-ball response examples:

outlook is good
ask again later
yes
no
most likely no
most likely yes
maybe
outlook is not good

Bonus!
Research the math library and create a program that finds the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given two sides.
